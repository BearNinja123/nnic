# nnic - Neural Networks in C

A simple neural network made in C. It's about as basic as you can get, but this is just a proof of concept that I could code a NN in C.
The network uses MSE loss, vanilla gradient descent, and a ReLU and sigmoid activation function. It is terribly difficult to add new layers into the network, but I would hope to find a way to use loops to add new layers instead of hardcoding them.

Some fun facts, this program was one of the first programs I made in C, and I also had to recode this project since I accidentally deleted it while trying to find out how Git worked. Oh well.
